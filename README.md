# N-Queens Problem Solver

A C++ program that solves the N-Queens problem by placing N queens on an NxN chessboard without conflicts. The program allows user input for different board sizes, visualizes the backtracking process, and displays solution numbering. When all solutions are exhausted, the program displays "No more solutions."

## Features
- Input any board size for N queens.
- Step-by-step visualization of the backtracking algorithm.
- Delay option to observe the queen placements and removals.
- Displays all solutions with numbering starting from 1.
- Prints "No more solutions" when all possible configurations are shown.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the desired board size.
2. The program uses backtracking to find valid placements for queens.
3. Each solution is displayed with a step-by-step visualization.
4. If no more solutions are available, the program prints "No more solutions."
